# Discord timestamp for PowerToys Run

A [PowerToys Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run) plugin for generating Discord timestamps,
inspired by the amazing [Discord Timestamp](https://discordtimestamp.com/) website.

To use type `dt` followed by a date and/or time. Dates and times can be specified in [wide range of natural
language forms](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic?tab=readme-ov-file#examples). Select the desired Discord
timestamp format from the resulting list then paste it into Discord.
